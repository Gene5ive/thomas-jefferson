### Description

**Q & A**

This App is only partially complete. I was unable to successfully add answers to questions. I was stuck on being able to identify the model of the question controller while inside the newAnswer controller. As a result, I could not push the new answer object into the question's answer array.

Consequently, I was also unable to fulfill the other requirements of being able to edit answers and questions.
